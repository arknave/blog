Hi, I'm Arnav! I was born in Naperville, IL, but grew up in Austin, TX. I attend The University of Texas at Austin, where I am a computer science major and a member of the Turing Scholars program. In addition to computer science, I enjoy restaurant trivia nights, competitive Super Smash Bros. and pop music.

I started programming during my sophomore year of high school when a classmate asked me to come to a programming competition. Immediately, I was hooked. Over the rest of my high school career, I devoured every programming-related resource I could find, learning about topics from algorithms and data structures to functional programming and website design. I've held two internships at [Indeed](http://www.indeed.com) and will be interning at [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) this upcoming summer.
